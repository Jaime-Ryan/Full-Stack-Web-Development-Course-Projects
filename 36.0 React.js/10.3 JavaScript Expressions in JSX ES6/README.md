## 🎮 Interactive Demo Features

The project includes an interactive demo showcasing:

- **Counter Example**: Demonstrates React 19's automatic optimization (no need for useCallback/useMemo)
- **Form Actions**: Shows the new form action feature for handling submissions
- **Modern Styling**: Responsive design with modern CSS

## 🔧 React 19 Code Examples

### Before React 19 (Old Way):
```jsx
// Needed manual optimization
const increment = useCallback(() => setCount(count + 1), [count]);
const doubleCount = useMemo(() => count * 2, [count]);

// Needed forwardRef for refs
const MyComponent = forwardRef((props, ref) => {
  return <div ref={ref}>Hello</div>;
});
```

### After React 19 (New Way):
```jsx
// Automatic optimization by React compiler
const increment = () => setCount(count + 1);
const doubleCount = count * 2;

// Ref as prop directly
const MyComponent = (props) => {
  return <div ref={props.ref}>Hello</div>;
};

// Form actions
const handleSubmit = async (formData) => {
  const value = formData.get("input");
  // Handle form submission
};

<form action={handleSubmit}>
  <input name="input" />
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

## 🚀 Performance Improvements

React 19 includes:
- **Automatic Memoization**: No need for manual useCallback/useMemo in most cases
- **Better Error Handling**: Improved error messages and debugging
- **Faster Hydration**: Better server-side rendering performance
- **Optimized Bundle Size**: Smaller JavaScript bundles
